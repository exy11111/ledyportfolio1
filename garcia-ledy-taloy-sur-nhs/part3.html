                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Before stepping into the classroom as a practice teacher, I constantly consulted my Cooperating Teacher (CT) for guidance on effectively dividing the lessons. Her advice shaped my planning process, especially since there were moments when I had just finished teaching one lesson and already had to prepare for the next one the following day. This cycle was mentally and physically demanding. Preparing instructional materials a day before became the norm, and thinking of fresh, creative strategies for classroom activities sometimes felt like a race against time.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Despite the rush and pressure, I remained open to new approaches—watching online teaching tips, crafting cinema-inspired lessons, and plotting ways to make each day better than the last. It wasn’t just about delivering content but about making the learning experience meaningful, interactive, and student-centered.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    When we were informed about the final date of our demo teaching, panic instantly set in. The idea of teaching while being formally observed by our Supervising Instructor (SI) was nerve-wracking. While we were used to being observed by our CT, the thought of being under the watchful eye of our SI felt like a new CCTV camera had been installed; every move, every word, would be scrutinized.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Weeks before the demo, while others were choosing their topics, I was still in awe, trying to process that the final stretch was near. I turned to TikTok for creative instructional material ideas and started mapping out my lessons. My CT and I reviewed my proposed lessons, and she suggested I undergo rated observations for five consecutive days to fine-tune everything. One piece of feedback stood out: smile more. That advice, simple yet powerful, influenced the tone of my final demo.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    I took inspiration from a rated demo where I used the “Dora the Explorer” strategy—an interactive, student-centered technique. My CT loved it and advised me to integrate it throughout the lesson, not just during motivation. That idea fueled the cinematic theme for my final demo. As the big day approached, instructional material preparation became intense, with creative ideas flooding my head and printer issues causing stress. But despite the chaos, my co-interns and I pushed through, working late into the night to bring our vision to life.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-1 fw-bold fs-5" style="text-align: justify">DURING</p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Teaching in real-time exposed me to the raw realities of the classroom. While many students were eager and cooperative, not all days were ideal. Some students rolled their eyes, threw paper balls while I was writing on the blackboard, and one even slept through the lesson despite being called out repeatedly. My CT advised me to save my energy and not get too stressed over behavior that hadn't changed since day one. Eventually, I learned when to let go—and when to persist. I also saw students genuinely struggling to understand the lesson. Although I initially had a rule to speak in English only, I broke that rule when necessary and translated some parts into the vernacular just so they could catch up. Their confusion slowly turned into understanding, and there was a quiet joy in seeing their once-blank faces light up with the realization that they were learning something new. I tried different strategies based on the needs of each section. One class thrived in group activities, while another preferred individual work. I adapted each time, even implementing a behavioral chart because neither shouting nor silence seemed to work. I walked around during evaluations to assist struggling learners and provide individual support. Yes, there were frustrating days—especially when students asked, "What is the English of..." repeatedly, or when some didn’t submit their assignments and blamed their grades on the fact that it was “not recorded.” But there was also fulfillment. Thirty out of thirty-six students getting 80% on their summative assessment wasn’t just a number—it was proof that learning was happening. 
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                The moment we had been anticipating and preparing for, when it was time for our final demo, I walked into the classroom with a mix of excitement and nervousness, knowing that this would be the culmination of all my preparation and practice. I started the session with the usual preliminaries, followed by a brief yet firm reinforcement of classroom management. I reminded the students of the classroom rules I had established during our first meeting, emphasizing respect, participation, and responsibility. Setting this tone early on helped maintain order throughout the lesson. I also reminded them of the behavioral chart that I had made, which consisted of three groups. If one member was noisy or disrupted the class, the group would have 3 points deducted from their starting 50 points. On the other hand, if a member answered correctly or if I observed that most of them were well-behaved, they would gain 3 additional points. For the motivation, I transformed the classroom into a make-believe cinema house. Though the students were already seated, they were told that they couldn’t “enter” the cinema until they had unlocked the “password.” The activity was called “What is the Password?” In front were two columns labeled Fact and Value, and several strips of paper with terms written on them. Randomly selected students identified whether the terms belonged to Fact or Value. This simple yet engaging warm-up activity sparked their curiosity and activated their prior knowledge. To segue into the lesson, I presented the day’s objectives printed on a large, handmade cinema ticket, symbolizing the next phase of their "cinema experience"—buying a ticket. It was a playful and symbolic way to inform them of what they should expect and learn by the end of the session. Next came the “Pick a Door” activity. I told the students we would now explore different “cinema rooms,” and each door led to a new learning experience: Door 1 revealed examples of factual statements under the Claim of Fact Door 2 showed examples of ethical and moral issues under the Claim of Value These activities introduced the core concepts of the lesson in an interactive and contextualized way. Afterward, we transitioned to the “movie” part of the lesson—the formal discussion of the concept. I walked them through the lesson while giving localized and relatable examples. In between explanations, I opened the floor for recitation to encourage participation and check for understanding. For Developing Mastery, I gave a group task in the form of a Criss Cross Puzzle. While the activity was engaging and fun for most students, it consumed more time than expected. I also noticed that some students who were not actively participating began scribbling in their notebooks, clearly disengaged. This taught me an important lesson: while collaborative tasks can boost learning, proper time management and clear group roles are necessary to keep everyone involved. For Practical Application, I asked the class a few situational questions. Some students were able to answer correctly with guidance, while others needed more prompting. I used this segment to casually check their understanding by pretending to ask, “Did you enjoy the movie?”—a light way of confirming if the lesson made sense to them. During Generalization, I asked them to share what they had learned from the class. Many gave thoughtful responses, showing that the cinema-themed format helped them retain the lesson better. Lastly, we proceeded to the Evaluation, which I called “The Movie Review.” The students answered a six-item worksheet where they categorized each statement as either a Claim of Fact (COF) or a Claim of Value (COV). As I walked around the classroom, I saw that most of the students had grasped the lesson well. However, a few were still struggling to differentiate between the two claims, showing me that more examples and reinforcement might be needed in the future. Overall, the lesson was delivered as planned, and I felt that the students were engaged and interested. There were minor setbacks, but the flow remained smooth, and the learning objective was mostly achieved. 
                </p>
                <p class="mb-1 fw-bold fs-5" style="text-align: justify">AFTER</p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Every time I finished a class, I asked myself, “Are you satisfied today?” Some days, the answer was yes—especially when I saw progress in their scores, or when students who once stared at me blankly could now explain the lesson on their own. Other days, the answer wasn’t so easy. Even the brightest student in the room would sometimes zone out. There were moments of anger, disappointment, and doubt. I’m not even joking when I say it felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders after the demo teaching. The relief that washed over me was unlike anything I had felt in weeks. What added to that feeling was when I tallied the students' scores after we checked their activities, and I was overwhelmed with joy knowing that most of them had understood the lesson. 
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    When it comes to my final demo, I’m not even joking when I say it felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders after the demo teaching. The relief that washed over me was unlike anything I had felt in weeks. That feeling grew stronger when I tallied the students' scores—31 out of 36 got at least 75%, the passing score. I was overwhelmed with joy knowing that most of them had understood the lesson. But at the same time, a nervous energy crept in… because the post-conference was still ahead of me.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    After gathering all my instructional materials, I made my way to the library, which had become my second home while staying at TSNHS. There, I found my Cooperating Teacher. I could see concern painted across her face, but the moment she saw me smiling, her expression softened. "I'm guessing it went well based on your facial expression," she said. I just crossed my fingers and smiled, silently hoping that it truly had.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Honestly, the post-conference made me more anxious than the actual teaching. Maybe it's because I had set such high expectations for myself and was afraid I hadn't met them. I kept replaying parts of my demo in my head, thinking about what I could’ve done better.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Then came the moment. Our Supervising Instructor (SI) called us in for the post-conference with my two fellow interns. The first thing she said immediately lit up the room and erased all our worries:
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-align: justify">
                    “Lisensya na lang ang kulang.”
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    That single line gave us the validation and assurance we didn’t even realize we were craving. We smiled, laughed a little, and finally felt at peace with everything we had worked so hard for.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    The feedback was very encouraging. My SI acknowledged that the flow of the lesson was clear and purposeful, and that the students were engaged. She advised me to work on incorporating more humor and lightness into my teaching to create a more relaxed atmosphere. She also introduced a strategy for Generalization called “3-2-1,” where students share three things they learned, two things they found interesting, and one question they still had. I tried applying this in my next lesson, but my students weren’t as active or responsive as I had hoped. Eventually, I returned to oral recitation, which felt more natural and effective for the group I was handling.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    The entire experience—from planning and executing the lesson to reflecting during the post-conference—was transformative. It reminded me that teaching isn’t about being perfect; it’s about being prepared, adaptable, and most importantly, present for your students.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Every lesson plan, every adjustment, every emotion was both a challenge and an opportunity. I realized that teaching isn’t about delivering flawless lessons or ensuring perfect behavior. It’s about adapting, caring, and staying grounded despite the chaos.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    This journey made me more aware of my potential, resilience, and passion. I know I still have much to learn, but I now understand that being a teacher means more than imparting knowledge—it means being present, persistent, and patient in the face of both success and struggle.

          <p class="mt-5" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
            These are the ten selected rating sheets I received during my internship at Taloy. Overall, I consider them high, even though my Cooperating Teacher (CT) never actually gave a score in the range of 8 (below 90) for any of my demo lessons. The ratings that went beyond 95% represent the demos I believe were successfully executed, where the learning activities were well-designed, student engagement was high, and the lesson objectives were met.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
            On the other hand, the lower ratings were mainly due to reduced student participation or certain parts of the lesson that lacked clarity or energy. Some students were passive, especially during group activities or discussions, and that reflected in the ratings given. Still, even in those moments, I took the feedback as an opportunity to grow and refine my approach. Each score, whether high or slightly lower, provided insight into the effectiveness of my strategies and classroom management. Looking back, these evaluations were not just numbers on a sheet—they were markers of my development as a future educator. They helped me recognize my strengths and acknowledge areas where I can continue to improve.

                Taloy Sur National High School provides a generally conducive learning environment that supports the delivery of quality education. One of the major strengths of the school is its location—it is conveniently situated along the highway, which makes transportation accessible for most students. Many of them ride jeepneys or shared services, and there is a clear culture of waiting for one another, showing strong camaraderie and discipline among learners. Despite its location near a busy road, the school enjoys a peaceful atmosphere, as the surrounding trees help block out noise and provide fresh air, creating a calm and healthy environment.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                In terms of facilities, the school offers several useful resources: an ICT room with over 20 functioning computers with internet access, a School Library and Reading Corner, a Science Laboratory with models and dioramas, and a TLE room equipped with sewing machines. These facilities greatly enhance hands-on learning and are instrumental in helping students engage with practical subjects. These should be sustained and regularly maintained to ensure continued functionality, especially the laboratory materials, sewing equipment, and computers. The natural environment, surrounded by greenery, should also be preserved as it contributes to students’ well-being.
              </p>
              
              <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                However, like many public schools, Taloy Sur National High School also faces some challenges. A key issue is the condition of the comfort rooms. Although students do their part in cleaning, there is no structured or scheduled general cleaning, which leads to poor hygiene and persistent odors. This negatively impacts students’ health and comfort. Additionally, many classrooms have electric fans that no longer work. Since the windows are covered with nets to keep mosquitoes out, proper ventilation is limited, and the heat becomes unbearable, especially during the dry season.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                Another concern is the absence of a spacious, covered court. While the school has a multipurpose social hall, it is not large enough to accommodate all students and community members during assemblies or school-wide events. Also, the school gulayan, once a promising project for both learning and income generation, is currently unmaintained. The plants are dried up, and weeds have overtaken the plots. This is a missed opportunity, especially considering the “No Collection Policy” by DepEd, which limits school fundraising options. Moreover, while the library is a vital resource, many of the books are outdated. In an era of evolving knowledge and changing curriculum, it is essential to provide students with updated, relevant, and engaging reading materials.
              </p>
              
              <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                To improve these conditions, school-community collaboration is crucial. The barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) can be tapped to help with the revitalization of the gulayan through regular planting activities, youth involvement, and shared maintenance. A strong partnership with the Parents-Teachers Association (PTA) can also support scheduled clean-up drives, fan repairs, and comfort room sanitation. For book updating, the school may initiate book donation drives in partnership with alumni, NGOs, and local publishers. The Department of Tourism or LGU may also be approached for structural improvements, such as fixing the ceilings and building a larger covered court that can benefit both the school and community events.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                Hence, while Taloy Sur National High School has several strengths that support quality education, including a strategic location, useful facilities, and a clean environment, there are still areas that require attention. With proper support, creative solutions, and strong community involvement, these challenges can be overcome, ensuring that every learner receives the safe, healthy, and well-equipped learning environment they deserve.
