                <p class="mb-1 fw-bold fs-5" style="text-align: justify">BEFORE</p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Before stepping into the classroom as a practice teacher, I constantly consulted my Cooperating Teacher (CT) for guidance on effectively dividing the lessons. Her advice shaped my planning process, especially since there were moments when I had just finished teaching one lesson and already had to prepare for the next one the following day. This cycle was mentally and physically demanding. Preparing instructional materials a day before became the norm, and thinking of fresh, creative strategies for classroom activities sometimes felt like a race against time.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Despite the rush and pressure, I remained open to new approaches—watching online teaching tips, crafting cinema-inspired lessons, and plotting ways to make each day better than the last. It wasn’t just about delivering content but about making the learning experience meaningful, interactive, and student-centered.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    When we were informed about the final date of our demo teaching, panic instantly set in. The idea of teaching while being formally observed by our Supervising Instructor (SI) was nerve-wracking. While we were used to being observed by our CT, the thought of being under the watchful eye of our SI felt like a new CCTV camera had been installed; every move, every word, would be scrutinized.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Weeks before the demo, while others were choosing their topics, I was still in awe, trying to process that the final stretch was near. I turned to TikTok for creative instructional material ideas and started mapping out my lessons. My CT and I reviewed my proposed lessons, and she suggested I undergo rated observations for five consecutive days to fine-tune everything. One piece of feedback stood out: smile more. That advice, simple yet powerful, influenced the tone of my final demo.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-5" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    I took inspiration from a rated demo where I used the “Dora the Explorer” strategy—an interactive, student-centered technique. My CT loved it and advised me to integrate it throughout the lesson, not just during motivation. That idea fueled the cinematic theme for my final demo. As the big day approached, instructional material preparation became intense, with creative ideas flooding my head and printer issues causing stress. But despite the chaos, my co-interns and I pushed through, working late into the night to bring our vision to life.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-1 fw-bold fs-5 mt-5" style="text-align: justify">DURING</p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Teaching in real-time exposed me to the raw realities of the classroom. While many students were eager and cooperative, not all days were ideal. Some students rolled their eyes, threw paper balls while I was writing on the blackboard, and one even slept through the lesson despite being called out repeatedly. My CT advised me to save my energy and not get too stressed over behavior that hadn't changed since day one. Eventually, I learned when to let go—and when to persist. I also saw students genuinely struggling to understand the lesson. Although I initially had a rule to speak in English only, I broke that rule when necessary and translated some parts into the vernacular just so they could catch up. Their confusion slowly turned into understanding, and there was a quiet joy in seeing their once-blank faces light up with the realization that they were learning something new. I tried different strategies based on the needs of each section. One class thrived in group activities, while another preferred individual work. I adapted each time, even implementing a behavioral chart because neither shouting nor silence seemed to work. I walked around during evaluations to assist struggling learners and provide individual support. Yes, there were frustrating days—especially when students asked, "What is the English of..." repeatedly, or when some didn’t submit their assignments and blamed their grades on the fact that it was “not recorded.” But there was also fulfillment. Thirty out of thirty-six students getting 80% on their summative assessment wasn’t just a number—it was proof that learning was happening. 
                </p>
                <p class="mb-5" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                The moment we had been anticipating and preparing for, when it was time for our final demo, I walked into the classroom with a mix of excitement and nervousness, knowing that this would be the culmination of all my preparation and practice. I started the session with the usual preliminaries, followed by a brief yet firm reinforcement of classroom management. I reminded the students of the classroom rules I had established during our first meeting, emphasizing respect, participation, and responsibility. Setting this tone early on helped maintain order throughout the lesson. I also reminded them of the behavioral chart that I had made, which consisted of three groups. If one member was noisy or disrupted the class, the group would have 3 points deducted from their starting 50 points. On the other hand, if a member answered correctly or if I observed that most of them were well-behaved, they would gain 3 additional points. For the motivation, I transformed the classroom into a make-believe cinema house. Though the students were already seated, they were told that they couldn’t “enter” the cinema until they had unlocked the “password.” The activity was called “What is the Password?” In front were two columns labeled Fact and Value, and several strips of paper with terms written on them. Randomly selected students identified whether the terms belonged to Fact or Value. This simple yet engaging warm-up activity sparked their curiosity and activated their prior knowledge. To segue into the lesson, I presented the day’s objectives printed on a large, handmade cinema ticket, symbolizing the next phase of their "cinema experience"—buying a ticket. It was a playful and symbolic way to inform them of what they should expect and learn by the end of the session. Next came the “Pick a Door” activity. I told the students we would now explore different “cinema rooms,” and each door led to a new learning experience: Door 1 revealed examples of factual statements under the Claim of Fact Door 2 showed examples of ethical and moral issues under the Claim of Value These activities introduced the core concepts of the lesson in an interactive and contextualized way. Afterward, we transitioned to the “movie” part of the lesson—the formal discussion of the concept. I walked them through the lesson while giving localized and relatable examples. In between explanations, I opened the floor for recitation to encourage participation and check for understanding. For Developing Mastery, I gave a group task in the form of a Criss Cross Puzzle. While the activity was engaging and fun for most students, it consumed more time than expected. I also noticed that some students who were not actively participating began scribbling in their notebooks, clearly disengaged. This taught me an important lesson: while collaborative tasks can boost learning, proper time management and clear group roles are necessary to keep everyone involved. For Practical Application, I asked the class a few situational questions. Some students were able to answer correctly with guidance, while others needed more prompting. I used this segment to casually check their understanding by pretending to ask, “Did you enjoy the movie?”—a light way of confirming if the lesson made sense to them. During Generalization, I asked them to share what they had learned from the class. Many gave thoughtful responses, showing that the cinema-themed format helped them retain the lesson better. Lastly, we proceeded to the Evaluation, which I called “The Movie Review.” The students answered a six-item worksheet where they categorized each statement as either a Claim of Fact (COF) or a Claim of Value (COV). As I walked around the classroom, I saw that most of the students had grasped the lesson well. However, a few were still struggling to differentiate between the two claims, showing me that more examples and reinforcement might be needed in the future. Overall, the lesson was delivered as planned, and I felt that the students were engaged and interested. There were minor setbacks, but the flow remained smooth, and the learning objective was mostly achieved. 
                </p>
                <p class="mb-1 fw-bold fs-5 mt-5" style="text-align: justify">AFTER</p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Every time I finished a class, I asked myself, “Are you satisfied today?” Some days, the answer was yes—especially when I saw progress in their scores, or when students who once stared at me blankly could now explain the lesson on their own. Other days, the answer wasn’t so easy. Even the brightest student in the room would sometimes zone out. There were moments of anger, disappointment, and doubt. I’m not even joking when I say it felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders after the demo teaching. The relief that washed over me was unlike anything I had felt in weeks. What added to that feeling was when I tallied the students' scores after we checked their activities, and I was overwhelmed with joy knowing that most of them had understood the lesson. 
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    When it comes to my final demo, I’m not even joking when I say it felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders after the demo teaching. The relief that washed over me was unlike anything I had felt in weeks. That feeling grew stronger when I tallied the students' scores—31 out of 36 got at least 75%, the passing score. I was overwhelmed with joy knowing that most of them had understood the lesson. But at the same time, a nervous energy crept in… because the post-conference was still ahead of me.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    After gathering all my instructional materials, I made my way to the library, which had become my second home while staying at TSNHS. There, I found my Cooperating Teacher. I could see concern painted across her face, but the moment she saw me smiling, her expression softened. "I'm guessing it went well based on your facial expression," she said. I just crossed my fingers and smiled, silently hoping that it truly had.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Honestly, the post-conference made me more anxious than the actual teaching. Maybe it's because I had set such high expectations for myself and was afraid I hadn't met them. I kept replaying parts of my demo in my head, thinking about what I could’ve done better.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Then came the moment. Our Supervising Instructor (SI) called us in for the post-conference with my two fellow interns. The first thing she said immediately lit up the room and erased all our worries:
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-align: justify">
                    “Lisensya na lang ang kulang.”
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    That single line gave us the validation and assurance we didn’t even realize we were craving. We smiled, laughed a little, and finally felt at peace with everything we had worked so hard for.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    The feedback was very encouraging. My SI acknowledged that the flow of the lesson was clear and purposeful, and that the students were engaged. She advised me to work on incorporating more humor and lightness into my teaching to create a more relaxed atmosphere. She also introduced a strategy for Generalization called “3-2-1,” where students share three things they learned, two things they found interesting, and one question they still had. I tried applying this in my next lesson, but my students weren’t as active or responsive as I had hoped. Eventually, I returned to oral recitation, which felt more natural and effective for the group I was handling.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    The entire experience—from planning and executing the lesson to reflecting during the post-conference—was transformative. It reminded me that teaching isn’t about being perfect; it’s about being prepared, adaptable, and most importantly, present for your students.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Every lesson plan, every adjustment, every emotion was both a challenge and an opportunity. I realized that teaching isn’t about delivering flawless lessons or ensuring perfect behavior. It’s about adapting, caring, and staying grounded despite the chaos.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    This journey made me more aware of my potential, resilience, and passion. I know I still have much to learn, but I now understand that being a teacher means more than imparting knowledge—it means being present, persistent, and patient in the face of both success and struggle.

            These are the ten selected rating sheets I received during my internship at Taloy. Overall, I consider them high, even though my Cooperating Teacher (CT) never actually gave a score in the range of 8 (below 90) for any of my demo lessons. The ratings that went beyond 95% represent the demos I believe were successfully executed, where the learning activities were well-designed, student engagement was high, and the lesson objectives were met.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
            On the other hand, the lower ratings were mainly due to reduced student participation or certain parts of the lesson that lacked clarity or energy. Some students were passive, especially during group activities or discussions, and that reflected in the ratings given. Still, even in those moments, I took the feedback as an opportunity to grow and refine my approach. Each score, whether high or slightly lower, provided insight into the effectiveness of my strategies and classroom management. Looking back, these evaluations were not just numbers on a sheet—they were markers of my development as a future educator. They helped me recognize my strengths and acknowledge areas where I can continue to improve.

                    OVERALL REFLECTION ABOUT MY ACTUAL TEACHING EXPERIENCE
                </div>
            </h3>
            <div class="container">
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Let me begin this with a deep sigh. When I read the questions, it instantly took me back to Taloy—the scent of the trees, the stressful nights, the bursts of laughter, and the quiet tears. When I first stepped into Taloy, I had one goal in mind: to meet the standards I set for myself and my students. That goal became my anchor throughout my teaching journey.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    If you ask me about the greatest improvement I’ve experienced due to my exposure to real teaching, I would say there are two aspects: one objective, the other subjective. Objectively, I improved significantly in lesson planning. I wouldn’t say I’m an expert, but I have become more confident in crafting attainable and measurable objectives. Alongside this, I learned how to carefully select suitable activities and craft clear, concise instructions.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Subjectively, I learned to value time more than ever. In teaching, every minute counts. I realized that a 45-minute lesson is barely enough to cover everything, especially when accounting for student participation and classroom management. This experience taught me the real value of every single minute.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Teaching brought so many realizations. First and foremost: teaching is not for the faint of heart. It truly is the noblest profession. For three months, I started and ended my day facing my laptop. The adjustment period during the first month was difficult, not to mention the added pressure of not receiving any monetary compensation—just kidding (sort of).
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    What struck me the most was how poor school management can kill a teacher’s passion. Schools need unity and support systems to provide quality education. I also saw firsthand that some DepEd policies don’t align with the realities on the ground. It’s disheartening that teachers, despite their hard work, are sometimes unsupported and underappreciated.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    My CT often told me I have the potential to become an effective teacher, and slowly, I began to believe it. Seeing my students improve in spelling, punctuation, and verb usage was deeply fulfilling. Teaching Subject-Verb Agreement and Subject-Verb-Object felt surreal; those were lessons I struggled with in high school, and now I was teaching them with clarity. I also discovered that I had a knack for incidental learning. Trivia and side lessons came to me naturally during class, and students were often curious and engaged.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    However, building rapport and setting classroom standards were among the hardest challenges. Despite being a social butterfly, I had difficulty connecting with my students at first. I chose to present a strict teaching persona to establish boundaries, fearing that being too friendly might lead to a lack of discipline. Ironically, I found it hard to smile in class, even though I’m usually bubbly outside. Some students joked with me outside the classroom, but I tried to maintain a professional distance. I realized I had unintentionally built a wall to protect my emotional well-being.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Another difficult reality was adjusting my expectations. I handled Grade 7 students from Monday to Thursday and Grade 9 on Fridays. I expected students to know the basics and submit quality work. But some couldn’t spell “typhoon” or even knew what an essay was. When I asked, "Do you know what an essay is?" they replied, "What is an essay, Ma'am?" That shocked me. It turns out that the traditional "formal theme writing" activity had been removed from the curriculum after the pandemic. I was also taken aback when students didn’t know what a margin was; some drew uneven lines by hand, while others submitted crumpled paper as final work. I couldn’t help but express my disbelief.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Despite these struggles, lesson planning came easily to me. My CT gave clear, detailed feedback which helped me improve. I also referred to the Lesson Exemplar for Grade 7, although I had to modify activities to suit my students’ capabilities. Working with my CT and co-interns was another positive experience. Even though we had limited resources with few cartolinas and a malfunctioning printer, I was still thankful for the free printing provided.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Living in a new place for three months was also exciting. It gave me a taste of independence, as I usually live with my mother and siblings in La Trinidad. One of the most exciting moments was our extension activity in February. The school rarely held programs, so the students were thrilled when we introduced a Freedom Wall and a Valentine’s photobooth. The excitement was contagious. Even before the flag ceremony, all our plastic flowers were sold out. Despite the limited time and resources, the students’ joy made everything worth it.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Another memorable moment was when I introduced puzzle activities. To my surprise, one of the least engaged students was the first to finish. It reminded me that every student has potential; they just need the right motivation.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Becoming a teacher has always been my dream. Deep in my heart, I know it’s meant for me. But during the internship, I was tested. Two days before my final demo, I missed school due to dysmenorrhea. That day, I had a major breakdown—the worst since my depressive episodes in high school. I nearly gave up on everything. Alone in the teachers’ quarters, I cried like never before. But I had to pick myself up. I had no choice. The final demo was coming.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Resuming class wasn’t easy. I had to fake smiles. Some students tested my patience. One lay on the floor pretending to sleep while I was fixing the TV. I lost my temper, shouted, and walked out of the classroom. I broke down in the library. My CT and another teacher took over. That same afternoon, the adviser required the class to write an apology letter before reclaiming their phones. Some cried, others didn’t care. One student handed me the letter saying, “I’ll pass this even if I didn’t do anything wrong.” I almost didn’t accept it.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Though many students were uninterested and didn’t follow instructions, I kept trying. I explored various strategies to address multiple intelligences. I now understand, there is no one-size-fits-all in teaching. Some students rolled their eyes when I got upset; some were too proud. While those things didn’t hurt me personally, it was difficult dealing with depression symptoms while trying to be a teacher.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Thankfully, I had my parents’ support and an incredibly understanding CT who guided me through. I learned to focus on students who wanted to learn and stopped stressing over those who didn’t. I coped through prayer and journaling. My CT taught me patience, but more than that, she gave me a powerful piece of advice: "Always smile."
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    Sometimes, we forget that life is worth living. We get so caught up in the struggles that we lose sight of the beauty around us.I entered Taloy hoping to set my passion on fire. Instead, I found a dying candle—my flame flickering, my passion dim, and myself completely off track. There were days I asked, "What if teaching isn't really for me?" Even when I did a great job, why did it still feel so empty?
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                    But maybe that's the truth about growth. It doesn’t always come with fireworks. Sometimes, it shows up quietly, in tears shed alone, in lessons learned the hard way, in small victories that go unnoticed. I may not have left Taloy burning with fiery passion, but I left with a steady light, faint, but real. A light that reminds me that teaching isn’t just about feeling inspired every day; it’s about choosing to show up, even when it’s hard. And maybe that’s what passion is.
