                    Taloy Sur National High School is located in Duplac, Taloy Sur, Tuba, Benguet, just a few meters from Marcos Highway near the boundary of La Union and Benguet. The school enjoys a relatively warmer climate compared to other parts of the province. It offers Junior High School at the old site and the General Academic Strand (GAS) for Senior High School at a separate new campus. The school has essential facilities such as a library, science laboratory, ICT room, TLE building, comfort rooms, a canteen, an administrative office, and a multi-purpose hall.

              “A teacher who is attempting to teach without inspiring the pupil with a desire to learn is hammering on cold iron.” — Horace Mann
              </i>

            <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
              Indeed, teaching, like what my teacher in TLE mentioned is not merely a profession but it is a mission. My teaching philosophy is rooted in Essentialism, a traditional and teacher-centered philosophy that focuses on instilling in students the foundational knowledge and skills necessary for success in life. According to Şahin (2018), essentialism in education asserts that <b>“common and essential ideas and skills belonging to a certain culture should be taught to all citizens at the same level,”</b> particularly at the primary school level. It emphasizes hard work, discipline, and academic rigor, and places the teacher as the central figure in the classroom, responsible for the orderly transmission of cultural and intellectual heritage. Essentialism maintains that the teacher is the source of knowledge and the primary guide for students’ learning. This philosophy prioritizes the mastery of core subjects such as <b>reading, writing, mathematics, and science.</b> Şahin (2018) explains that essentialist education focuses on the teacher's role in instilling students with essential characteristics such as discipline, respect for authority, and strong academic habits. It aims to prepare learners to become well-rounded and responsible members of society. 
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
              In addition, Della Perez (2020) defines essentialism as a philosophy that requires the curriculum to focus on a common core of knowledge, stressing the need for schools to cultivate academic excellence and maintain high expectations. She explains that essentialism is grounded in the belief that <b>“education should be practical and prepare students to become valuable members of society,”</b> and that teachers are expected to direct the learning process, maintaining order and structure in the classroom. This interpretation strengthens my conviction that essentialism is not only about content, but also about shaping responsible and disciplined individuals through systematic and intentional instruction. 
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
              This philosophy resonates deeply with my own values and experiences as a pre-service teacher. It aligns with the goal I hold close to my heart: that my students will learn the foundational skills they need—especially in reading and writing. My internship at Taloy Sur National High School (TSNHS) was a turning point for me. I was honestly shocked to see that many students struggled with basic essay writing, proper margins, indentation, and even subject-verb agreement. These are fundamental skills, and their absence made it clear to me how urgent and necessary essentialism is in today’s classroom. Although I recognize that other educational philosophies such as constructivism, humanism, and behaviorism are good and adaptable to change, my internship experience opened my eyes to the current realities of working with today’s generation of learners. Gone are the days when teachers were naturally respected by students. In many classrooms, neither raising one’s voice nor using gentle, encouraging tones can effectively instill discipline. While others may have had more positive experiences, I frequently hear stories that echo my own—stories of young minds who struggle with respect, self-regulation, and accountability.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
              This is why I firmly stand by my belief in essentialism. However, I want to clarify that my philosophy does not suggest that the teacher should be the only source of knowledge. I fully embrace the idea that students can learn effectively through collaborative efforts, especially when mentored by their peers. Essentialism, for me, means establishing clear standards, structure, and discipline while still nurturing a dynamic learning environment where learners are empowered to grow—academically, socially, and morally. I believe that a strong foundation in the basics, coupled with consistent guidance and peer support, can shape them into responsible, independent thinkers.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
              In implementing this teaching philosophy, I aim to prioritize the mastery of fundamental skills such as basic grammar rules, sentence construction, reading comprehension, and clear written expression. I have tried applying this approach with my Grade 7 students. While the average to above-average learners seemed to enjoy and engage with the lessons, many of the others appeared disengaged, often staring out the window as if lost in their own world.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
              I admit that the lack of resources—such as the unavailability of a Smart TV due to scheduling conflicts forced me to rely heavily on traditional lecture methods and printed materials. I believe this significantly contributed to the decline in students' interest and participation. Through this experience, I realized that integrating different teaching philosophies becomes more effective when paired with technology and examples that resonate with students' sense of humor and current interests. While it is undoubtedly a challenging task, especially considering factors such as varying maturity levels, even a small glimpse into current social media trends can be a powerful tool in connecting with learners. It allows teachers to present lessons in ways that feel more relatable, engaging, and accessible. Moving forward, I aim to be more adaptive by blending essentialist principles with modern tools and culturally relevant content, ensuring that learning remains both structured and meaningful for every student.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
              Essentialism will help me remain focused on these core skills, rather than being swayed by educational fads or abstract teaching methods. My classroom will be structured, with high expectations, not to restrict learners but to provide them with a solid foundation they can carry into the future. I want my students to leave the four corners of my classroom with the ability to write a simple but organized essay, follow grammar rules, and express themselves with clarity. Essentialism also addresses educational issues that I witnessed firsthand at TSNHS. Many students appeared disengaged or uninterested in schoolwork—not because they lacked intelligence or potential, but because they lacked confidence and mastery of the basics. When students fail to grasp foundational skills, they often feel lost and give up easily. Essentialism’s emphasis on structured, rigorous instruction helps resolve this issue by focusing on what truly matters: equipping students with the core knowledge and skills they need.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
              Moreover, Essentialism asserts that education must transmit the cultural and intellectual heritage of a society (Şahin, 2018; Della Perez, 2020). This is done through traditional disciplines and the use of classic texts, providing students not only with academic knowledge but with values such as respect, perseverance, and responsibility. These are the very qualities I want to nurture in my students. Şahin (2018) emphasizes that teachers must be academically well-qualified, promote learning, and be strong leaders in the classroom. I embrace that challenge. I understand that my role is not only to teach content but also to guide character development and instill a sense of purpose. By implementing essentialism, I will structure my lessons to ensure that every student has the opportunity to learn, participate, and grow. I will uphold discipline, not for control, but to provide a safe and respectful learning environment.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
              In our world today, where educational gaps are more visible than ever, we need philosophies that center on what truly matters. Essentialism does not ignore the challenges students face—it confronts them head-on by focusing on strong foundations, clear goals, and the value of effort. I believe that if we return to the basics and teach them well, we can build learners who are capable, confident, and prepared to thrive.

            <p class="mb-1 fw-bold fs-5" style="text-align: justify">INTENT</p>
            <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
              As an aspiring educator, I firmly intend to make learning meaningful for every student that enters my classroom. My ultimate goal is to ensure that no learner leaves without gaining knowledge, developing a skill, or learning something new that they can apply in real life. I believe that every moment spent in the classroom must count. Every word I speak, every activity I facilitate, and every lesson I deliver should contribute to their intellectual, emotional, and moral growth. I understand that teaching is not simply about delivering content—it's about inspiring curiosity, nurturing character, and instilling a love for lifelong learning.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
              Teaching is my calling, and I carry with me the deep responsibility to be a guide and a light to my learners. I aim to be a teacher who not only teaches minds but also touches hearts and shapes futures. I am committed to making my classroom a place where learning is both rigorous and rewarding, where students are encouraged to think critically, ask questions, and believe in their ability to succeed.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-1 fw-bold fs-5" style="text-align: justify">ACTION</p>
            <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
              To fulfill this commitment, I will diligently prepare for every lesson. I will make sure that each session is well-planned, engaging, and responsive to the diverse needs of my learners. I will utilize different strategies and approaches—whether traditional or modern—that cater to varying learning styles. I will integrate technology, relevant examples, and real-world applications whenever possible, making lessons more relatable and enjoyable. I will foster a safe, inclusive, and respectful learning environment where every learner feels seen, heard, and supported.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
              I also commit to constantly improving myself as an educator. I will welcome feedback with humility, reflect on my teaching practices, and seek continuous professional development to grow in both competence and character. I believe that an effective teacher is also a lifelong learner, willing to evolve with time and the needs of the students.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-1 fw-bold fs-5" style="text-align: justify">CONSEQUENCE</p>
            <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
              If my students achieve success, show improvement, and demonstrate a genuine interest in learning, then I will know that I am doing something right. Their progress—be it academic, behavioral, or emotional—will be a reflection of my dedication and my effectiveness as a teacher. But even when they struggle, I will not give up on them. I will adapt, try new strategies, and walk with them in their learning journey.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3" style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
              Ultimately, my commitment as a future member of the education teaching force is to contribute to the improvement and sustenance of quality education. I will do my part in fulfilling the objectives of education by producing not just academically competent individuals, but also responsible, respectful, and compassionate citizens. I may only be one teacher, but I believe that even one teacher can make a lifelong impact. This is my promise—as an educator, a mentor, and a servant of learning.
